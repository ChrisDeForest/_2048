## Description
_2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game in which the goal is to obtain a singular **2048** tile.

When two tiles of the same value are merged, they form one tile of double value.

> [!TIP]
> 
> Tiles can be moved using **WASD** or the **ARROW KEYS**.

Similar to the original game, the game can be continued once a 2048 tile has been obtained
